# Uzz-ify Word Converter

With words such as "huzz" and "bruzz" becoming words that generations such as Gen Alpha, and Gen Z, use, becoming an integral part of our modern day life. I decided to created a website so that people convert your words,phrases, or even sentences into the lanaguge of a Gen Z/Alpha person.


## How to Use
1. Open https://uzz-converter.vercel.app/ 
2. Enter in a word or sentence inside the input area marked with "Enter your word here"
3. Click the "Uzz-ify this word" button or press Enter to convert
4. View the result(s) and recent history

## Example Use Case
| Input       | Output       |
|-------------|--------------|
| hello       | helluzz      |
| f           | fuzz         |
| this is fun | thuzz isuzz funuzz |
